Free Support is available via [Github Issues](https://github.com/jube-home/jube/issues). Enterprise Support is $990 per month without long term commitment. Enterprise Support is private, direct and dedicated access to the developer via helpdesk ticketing.

Enterprise Support is guidance in the use of documented features.  Enterprise Support includes expedited remedy of bugs present in the software as documented.

The profile of an Enterprise Support user is that of a large organization (e.g. mid to large bank or payment institution) with dedicated access to a software engineering team. Enterprise Support offers a response time within 24 hours, delivered between 9am and 5pm US Central Time (CET).  Enterprise Support does not include production support and Jube can't guarantee emergency responsiveness.

Integration and expedited feature development is $187 per hour delivered as agreed Statement of Work (SoW).

Enterprise Support is otherwise governed by the Jube Operations Limited Terms of Service, in matters relating to Insurances, Confidentiality, Warranties and Limitations.

For users without dedicated access to a software engineering team, Jube has System Integrator and Consulting partners that are skilled in the use of the software.  Partners provide engineering capacity, production support and emergency responsiveness on a retained, time and material basis.
