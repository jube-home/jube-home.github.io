# Training
Jube offers a training program that focuses on achieving proficiency in the effective implementation and utilization of Jube. 

For the Americas, biannually, a training program is conducted in New York, US, at a venue to be shared closer to the time. For Europe, Middle East and Africa, biannually also, a training program is conducted in Larnaca, Cyprus, at a venue to be shared closer to the time. The Larnaca program is more cost effective owing to foreign travel not being required of the trainer. The training is delivered by Richard Churchman, the author of Jube.

The schedule covers a duration of three days, with the length of each day ranging from 6 to 8 hours, depending on the undertaking of Elective Modules. Elective Modules cover in-depth training in advanced administrative concepts using dedicated training servers.  Elective Modules are targeted at technical participants whom are likely to assume overall system administrative responsibility of an implementation of Jube.

Where confidentially considerations exist, the same program can be made available at the client's premises for a daily rate of USD 1200, excluding customary business travel and accommodation costs.  Remote programs are not generally offered given observations of reduced practical participation and outcome.

# Support
Free Support is available via [Github Issues](https://github.com/jube-home/jube/issues) on a best endeavour basis. Commercial Support available at a daily rate of USD 1200 prorated. It is uncommon for a client to require more than two days of Commercial Support per month given an active production implementation,  although implementation demands vary depending on client technical proficiency.
