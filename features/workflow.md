subtitle: Human intervention is gracefully orchestrated with comprehensive case management and visualisation.
---

Transaction or event monitoring overlooks the embedding in human-engaging business processes. Jube is real-time, but this does not forgo the need for manual intervention; hence Jube makes comprehensive and highly customisable case management and visualisation intrinsically available in the user interface.

To ensure the segregation of user responsibilities, a user, role and permission model is in place, which controls access to each page within the Jube user interface. Detailed audit logs are available. Any update to a configuration by a user retains a version history, in which the original is logically deleted and then replaced with the new version.

Jube is multi-tenanted, allowing a single infrastructure to be shared among many logically isolated entities, maintaining total isolation between tenant data with no loss of function in the user interface.
